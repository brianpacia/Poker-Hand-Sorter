# Poker-Hand-Sorter (C++)

Task:
You are to build a command line program that takes, via STDIN, a "stream" of hands for a two-player
poker game. At the completion of the stream, your program should print to STDOUT the number of
hands won by Player 1, and the number of hands won by Player 2.

## How to run:
**Open PowerShell or Command Prompt**

**Compile** using g++:
```
g++ PokerHandSorter.cpp -o PokerHandSorter
```
Feed input file into program and output the result in an output file:

**PowerShell**:
```
cmd /c '.\PokerHandSorter.exe < poker-hands.txt > output.txt'
```

**Command Prompt**:
```
.\PokerHandSorter.exe < poker-hands.txt > output.txt
```
